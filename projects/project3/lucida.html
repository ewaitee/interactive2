		<div id="abouttext"><p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Lucida Sans;">About Lucida Sans</p>Lucida, created by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes for Imagen, was the first original type family intended for laser printing. It was specifically designed with short sturdy serifs and low-stroke contrast to reproduce well when printed at low resolution (300 dpi). (Pellucida, a bitmapped companion intended for 72 dpi screen use, was released in 1986.) Lucida was also the first type family to revive Jan van Krimpen’s dream of a unified serif and sans serif design. This once-radical idea has since become fairly commonplace.<br>
Lucida Sans Italic was also the first sans serif to have a true italic rather than an oblique, a practice that has been widely imitated since. (It was not the first chancery sans serif however. That honor belongs to Gerard Unger’s Flora [1980], originally designed to work with his Praxis [1977], both of which were issued by Hell. But Flora also functioned as a stand-alone face and that is how it has been viewed since ITC bought its rights and used it to inaugurate their Typographica series in 1989.)
