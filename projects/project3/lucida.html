    	<!-- about text 
		<div id="abouttext"><p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Lucida Sans SansSans;">About Lucida Sans SansSans</p>Lucida Sans, created by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes for Imagen, was the first original type family intended for laser printing. It was specifically designed with short sturdy serifs and low-stroke contrast to reproduce well when printed at low resolution (300 dpi). (PelLucida Sans, a bitmapped companion intended for 72 dpi screen use, was released in 1986.) Lucida Sans Sanswas also the first type family to revive Jan van Krimpen’s dream of a unified serif and sans serif design. This once-radical idea has since become fairly commonplace.<br>
Lucida Sans SansSans Italic was also the first sans serif to have a true italic rather than an oblique, a practice that has been widely imitated since. (It was not the first chancery sans serif however. That honor belongs to Gerard Unger’s Flora [1980], originally designed to work with his Praxis [1977], both of which were issued by Hell. But Flora also functioned as a stand-alone face and that is how it has been viewed since ITC bought its rights and used it to inaugurate their Typographica series in 1989.)
